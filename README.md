# Noto CJK Font

This package contains a pre-built CJK font [`NotoSerifCJK-Light.ttf`](NotoSerifCJK-Light.ttf). You can use this font to display the common Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and Japanese characters with only one font file. This is particularly useful for Kobo e-readers because its font fallback mechanism is not very good.

Any missing characters can be reported to us ;-)

In addition, this package also contains a tool which can be used to produce the above CJK font file. You can use this tool to produce Sans Serif CJK font.

# Font Installation

Download the pre-built CJK font [`NotoSerifCJK-Light.ttf`](NotoSerifCJK-Light.ttf) and install the font.

If you are using Kobo, you can follow this guide to install the font: https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/13009477876631-Load-fonts-onto-your-Kobo-eReader

# Script Usage

You can install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` first.

Then you can run the script to produce the CJK font file that contains the common Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

This is an example of how to run the script:

```
python3 merge-cjk-font.py \
    --latin NotoSerif-Light.ttf \
    --zh-cn NotoSerifSC-Light.ttf \
    --zh-tw NotoSerifTC-Light.ttf \
    --add-latin1 \
    --add-general-punct \
    --general-punct-owner zh \
    --add-cjk-punct \
    --add-jp-syllabaries \
    --add-halfwidth \
    --add-han-basic \
    --drop-tables vhea vmtx \
    --out NotoSerifCJK-Light.ttf
```

`--general-punct-owner` can redirect the general punctuation block (U+2000–U+206F)
to a specific language tag (e.g., `zh` to keep curly quotes from a CJK font while
leaving Latin elsewhere). If omitted, the normal prefer order is used.
